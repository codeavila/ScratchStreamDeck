# ScratchStreamDeck
Check my post on my blog and video Demo

In this post, I'll share a project that emerged during the pandemic, where I created a keyboard for my 6-year-old daughter to attend her Google Meet classes without any hassle. The keyboard only had three buttons: "Raise Hand", "Mute/Unmute Mic", and "End Call".

Later on, this project gained momentum as I wanted to delve into the streaming world, leading me to develop a more refined version 1 compared to the initial version.
